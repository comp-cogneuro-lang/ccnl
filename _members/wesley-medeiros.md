I am a 2nd year PhD student in Psychological Sciences at the University of Connecticut, advised by Dr. James Magnuson and Dr. Rachel Theodore. 

My current interests are non-invasive brain data collection (e.g. EEG, fNIRS, fMRI), computational models of speech perception, and individual differences in phoneme categorization during speech.

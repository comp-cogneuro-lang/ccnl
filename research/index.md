Cognition and action "in the wild" occur in rich contexts. Our research explores how information from multiple sources is integrated in naturalistic tasks, using a combination of behavioral and neural methods and computational modeling. Our research interests include: neurobiology of language; speech perception; spoken word recognition; sentence processing; reading; language development; developmental and acquired disorders of language; computational models as theory-building tools; developing comprehensive understanding of language plasticity over the lifespan from cognitive, neural and genetic perspectives through interdisciplinary collaborations. For more details, see our publications.

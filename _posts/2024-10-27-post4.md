We are thrilled to announce the publication of our latest research paper, “Simple Recurrent Networks are Interactive,”  just accepted at Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. It authored by James S. Magnuson and Sahil Luthra. 

There is ongoing debate among cognitive scientists about whether Simple Recurrent Networks (SRNs) are feedforward systems. SRNs have been pivotal in advancing theories of learning, development, and processing in cognitive science for over three decades. If SRNs were feedforward systems, it would imply that their functions could be explained without interaction (feedback). However, despite some claims to the contrary, SRNs are not feedforward. Feedforward networks are acyclic graphs with no loops, whereas SRNs contain loops from hidden units back to hidden units with a time delay, making them cyclic graphs.

We discuss the theoretical implications of this through a key example from psycholinguistics, highlighting the crucial ramifications of whether SRNs are feedforward or interactive.

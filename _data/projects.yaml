  description: This is a repository of lab notes, where X might be “batch adjust F0 in speech files” and Y might be “Praat”, or X in Y = “create a hash table” in “R”. The idea is to have a quick place to put our notes about common or uncommon tasks so that we stop reinventing various wheels.

  description:  In this project, we intend to measure whether differences in speech perception 
  measured prior to learning a new sound may impact lexical biasing effects over that said sound. Positive results may support the presence of such changes, 
  predicted in the literature, and reinforce the need to emphasize individual differences when studying strategies in speech categorization.

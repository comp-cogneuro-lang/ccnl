Welcome to the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Language Lab! We are a passionate team of researchers dedicated to unraveling the complexities of language and cognition. Our lab explores how the brain processes language through a blend of behavioral experiments, neural imaging, and computational modeling.

We are particularly interested in understanding the neurobiology of language, speech perception, spoken word recognition, and sentence processing. Our research spans across various domains, including language development, reading, and both developmental and acquired language disorders. By integrating information from multiple sources and using advanced computational models, we aim to build comprehensive theories of language processing and plasticity.

What excites us the most is the potential to uncover how language functions in real-world contexts and how it adapts over the lifespan. Our interdisciplinary collaborations allow us to push the boundaries of knowledge and develop innovative approaches to studying language. Join us on this fascinating journey as we delve into the intricate workings of the human mind and its remarkable ability to communicate.

**Opportunities:** The lab admits new PhD students most years (applications due December 1). We are a core lab with the NSF-funded NRT training program Science of Learning & Art of Communication (Jim Magnuson, PI). We almost always have room for undergraduate students who want to be involved in research. We occasionally have openings for postdocs or technicians (see [Positions]((https://www.microsoft.com))). Prospective students, postdocs, or lab techs should feel free to send inquiries to Jim Magnuson.
